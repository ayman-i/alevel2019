To run the game, please place all **code** and **individual image** files into one folder and run 'MainCode.py'. *

(*) **NOTE:** After running the game for the first time, please comment out line 14 in the MainCode.py file by placing a '#' just before the code "create_tables()" if you wish to make saves of the game. i.e. "#create_tables()"
